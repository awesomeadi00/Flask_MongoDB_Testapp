# 1. Instantiate the app: 
# The built-in Python variable __name__ refers to the string "__main__". This is exactly lik calling the main() function in any other language. 
# If the Python file within which the __name__ variable is mentioned has been imported into another Python script, it will refer to a string with the name of the imported script file.
# Thus, __name__ makes it easy to determine whether code is running in the main script file or in an imported script file.
app = Flask(__name__)


# 2. Load credentials and configuration options from .env file
# This file is necessary to run the appliaction. It contains sensitive environment variables holding credentials such as the database connection string, username, password, etc. 
# This file should be excluded from version control in the .gitignore file.
load_dotenv()  # Take environment variables from .env.


# 3. Set up the connection to the mongoDB database through pymongo

# We check if the FLASK_ENV is on development through the .env file, we turn on debugging

# Connect to the database: 
# You connect through this function ("your_db_host", 27017, username="your_db_username", password="your_db_password", authSource="your_db_name")
# In our case, we load the URI through the .env file through localHost, 27017, username: admin, password: secret, Test_App and a TimeOut server at port 5000

    return render_template('index.html', docs=docs) # We pass docs = docs as a parameter so that in index.html, they can utilize all the data here and from the database. 

# We create another route where we specify the method as POST as we're going to supply some information (name, message) to the our request to the server
@app.route('/create', methods=['POST'])
def create_post(): 
    # We request the form information from the html page into these variables using flask 
    name = request.form['fname']

    # We create a new document with this information
    doc = {

        "created _at": datetime.datetime.utcnow()
    }

    # We insert this new document into our 'messages' database
    db.messages.insert_one(doc)
    # Makes a request for the / route, so redirects the user back to the home page
    return redirect(url_for('home'))


# We create another route where we parameterize the route with a specific post_id, since we are editing one post. Once again the method is POST since we're supplying data
@app.route('/edit/<post_id>', methods=['POST'])

    # Here, we update one of the elements in the 'messages' database, only the ones which have the id as assigned from the server, so the exact post with that id.
    # the $set operator is used to indicate which fields in the document should be updated, since we're updating the entire document, we just pass the edited 'doc' to the set
    db.messages.update_one(
        {"_id": ObjectId(post_id)},
        {"$set": doc}
    )

    # Once complete, we then make a request to redirect back to the home page '/'
    return redirect(url_for('home'))


# We create another route where we delete a particular post using parameterizing to specify which post to delete
@app.route('/delete/<post_id>')
def delete_post(post_id):
    #Here we delete one element from the 'messages' database which has the the same id as the one prompted by the server. 
    db.messages.delete_one({"_id": ObjectId(post_id)})
    return redirect(url_for('home')) 

# Here we have a final app route which involves any error_handling
# In case the connection to the database in unsuccessful, it passes the Exception and error into this route where it prompts the error.html page
@app.errorhandler(Exception)
def handle_error(err):
    return render_template('error.html', error=err)


# Runs the app, this is what acts as the main() function from the initialization of the __name__ earlier: 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    PORT = os.getenv('PORT', 5000) # Use the PORT environment variable, or default to 5000
    app.run(port=PORT)
