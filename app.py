# 1. Instantiate the app: 
# The built-in Python variable __name__ refers to the string "__main__". This is exactly lik calling the main() function in any other language. 
# If the Python file within which the __name__ variable is mentioned has been imported into another Python script, it will refer to a string with the name of the imported script file.
# Thus, __name__ makes it easy to determine whether code is running in the main script file or in an imported script file.

# 2. Load credentials and configuration options from .env file
# This file is necessary to run the appliaction. It contains sensitive environment variables holding credentials such as the database connection string, username, password, etc. 
# This file should be excluded from version control in the .gitignore file.

# MONGO_DBNAME = your_db_name
# MONGO_URI = "mongodb://your_db_username:your_db_password@your_db_host_server_name:27017/your_db_name?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"

    return redirect(url_for('home')) 

# Here we have a final app route which involves any error_handling
# In case the connection to the database in unsuccessful, it passes the Exception and error into this route where it prompts the error.html page
